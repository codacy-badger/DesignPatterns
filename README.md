Collection of various design patterns with example implementation in C++. Creational, Structural and Behavioral design patterns have been implemented. This also includes some of the commonly used Idiom in C++ programming. This is just to demonstrate the usage of the design patterns. 

**Note:** Code is NOT optimized but is used as a part of knowledge sharing.

#### Creational Design Patterns 

| Pattern Name | Description  |
| :---   | :--- |
| [Factory Method] | General object construction is replaced with a specific method |
| [Abstract Factory] | Group of related class without specifying concrete implementation |
| [Builder] | Stepwise construction of Complex objects|
| [Prototype] | Object constructed from a prototype|
| [Singleton] | Build Class with single instance|

#### Structural Design Patterns
| Pattern Name | Description  |
| :---   | :--- |
| [Adapter] | Link Objects with incompatable interfaces/classes |
| [Bridge] | |
| [Composition] | |
| [Decorator] | |
| [Facade] | |
| [Flyweight] | |
| [Proxy] | |

#### Behavioral Design Patterns
